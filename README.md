## Who are we?

WE4LKD is a brazilian research group consisting of undergraduate, master's, doctoral, and postdoctoral students with a strong focus on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Our primary objective is to study, analyze, explore, and propose effective real-world NLP applications. Through the use of word embeddings, we aim to uncover hidden knowledge and patterns in textual data to extract valuable insights and improve various applications in different fields.

  <h2>Accelerating Discoveries in Medicine using Distributed Vector Representations of Words</h2>
  <strong>Berto, Matheus V. V.; De Freitas, Breno L.; Scarton, Carolina E.; Neto, João A. M.; Almeida, Tiago A.</strong><br>
</div>

This study aims to extend a recently proposed strategy by combining different unsupervised models to accelerate discoveries in medicine. Distributed vector representations of words were trained on a large corpus of medical papers related to Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), a highly malignant form of cancer, and show that established therapies could be developed years before their first proposal. The results open new avenues toward faster medical discoveries through more effective drug and gene testing, enabling better treatments to promote a healthier, prolonged life for patients.

Our models were able to identify and suggest testing of some of the currently known compounds used to treat AML up to 11 years before they were explicitly mentioned in the literature, as illustrated below. The remainder of this repository describes the evolution of the project.

## Contributing

We encourage you to contribute to our project! Please check out the
[Issued](https://github.com/matheusvvb-19/WE4LKD-leukemia_w2v/issues)
page.

## Getting Started

This section provides a high-level quick start guide. If you're looking for a
more thorough installation guide (for example
[with macOS](https://developers.forem.com/getting-started/installation/mac),
you'll want to refer to our complete
[Developer Documentation](https://developers.forem.com/).

We run on a [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) backend, and we are currently
transitioning to a [Preact](https://preactjs.com/)-first frontend.

A more complete overview of our stack is available in
[our docs](https://developers.forem.com/technical-overview/stack).

To **launch Forem in Gitpod**, navigate to
